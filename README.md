# AI-Guided Screening of Traditional Chinese Medicine Compounds Using Gene Expression Signatures

**Rachel Ren & Alex Manko**  
*Artificial Intelligence in Genomics — Final Project, Spring 2026*

---

## Overview

This project trains a neural network to predict how a chemical compound affects biological pathway activity using the LINCS L1000 gene expression dataset, then applies the trained model to screen 4,983 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) compounds for predicted therapeutic effects. The pipeline is inspired by Tu Youyou's Nobel Prize-winning discovery of artemisinin — computationally replicating at scale what was previously done through years of manual laboratory screening.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install pandas cmapPy requests rdkit
```

### Step 1 — LINCS Preprocessing

Place all three LINCS raw files in the `lincs/` folder, then run in order:

```bash
cd lincs
python3 load_data.py          # outputs: lincs_landmark_with_compounds.csv
python3 preprocess.py         # outputs: lincs_clean.csv
python3 get_lincs_smiles.py   # outputs: lincs_with_smiles.csv
```

### Step 2 — TCM Preprocessing

Place the TCMID SDF file in the `tcm/` folder, then run:

```bash
cd tcm
python3 get_tcm_smiles.py     # outputs: tcm_smiles.csv
```

### Step 3 — Model Training and TCM Screening

Upload the following files to Google Drive:
- `lincs_with_smiles.csv`
- `tcm_smiles.csv`
- `c2.all.v2026.1.Hs.entrez.gmt`

Then open and run `AiG_Project.ipynb` in Google Colab. The notebook is available in the Google Drive link above.

The notebook handles:
- TCM/LINCS overlap removal
- Morgan fingerprint computation
- Pathway score computation from the GMT file
- Hyperparameter grid search (72 configurations)
- MLP model training and evaluation
- TCM compound screening and ranking
